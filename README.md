# CST8288 Lab 3 - Shannon's Theorem (MVC)
This was my third lab assignment in my "Object-Oriented Programming with Design Patterns" course. This lab required refactoing <a href="https://github.com/richard1990/CST8288-Lab2">Lab 2 (Refactored Shannon's Theorem)</a> to implement a model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern and the Observer design pattern. The user is presented with a GUI where they can enter the hertz and signal-to-noise ratio in JTextFields and see the result within the GUI. The user can also use a JScrollBar to reduce/increase the variables, which is updated using a Graphics object to paint horizontal bars representing the values (the maximum hertz can be is 3000, while the maximum the signal-to-noise ratio can be is 30).

Three panels in the program act as the "views" within the MVC design pattern - ShannonsPanel, ShannonsSliderPanel, and ShannonsGraphicPanel. Each of these classes implement the Observer interface. ShannonsController is an interface that defines the methods available in the controller, while ShannonsTheorem now implements this interface. ShannonsModel now inherits the Observable class and notifies the Observers of changes.

The program makes use of various GUI elements such as GridLayouts, JScrollBars, JTextFields, JScrollBars, ActionListeners, AdjustmentListeners, and paint components. I also made use of JUnit 4 to once again test the ShannonsModel and ShannonsTheorem classes.
